# Builder task — How a builder task works

When the governance process reaches a builder task, the following steps are executed:

1. **Activate the job.** The agent pulls the next pending job from the governance process running on Camunda, along with its skill name, skill mode, and run configuration.
1. **Execute the skill.** The agent runs the ProcessOS Harness skill named in the job, producing or updating files in your project.
1. **Take your builder action.** You review what the skill produced, correct it, rerun it, or do whatever else the situation needs. This is the open part of the task.
1. **Commit to version control.** The result is committed to Git, which makes the change part of the permanent project record.
1. **Complete the job.** The agent pushes the outcome back to the governance process, which then decides the next step.

Steps 1 and 5 are handled by the agent against Camunda. You handle step 3.
