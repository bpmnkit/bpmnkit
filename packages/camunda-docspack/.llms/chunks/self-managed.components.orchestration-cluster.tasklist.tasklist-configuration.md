# Configuration

As a Spring Boot application, Tasklist supports any standard
[Spring configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html) method.

By default, the configuration for Tasklist is stored in a YAML file `application.yml`. All Tasklist-related settings are prefixed with `camunda.tasklist`.

**Note**
Configuration properties can be defined as environment variables using [Spring Boot conventions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.environment-variables). To define an environment variable, convert the configuration property to uppercase, remove any dashes, and replace any delimiters (`.`) with `_`.

For example, the property `server.servlet.context-path` is represented by the environment variable `SERVER_SERVLET_CONTEXT_PATH`.

The following components are configurable:
