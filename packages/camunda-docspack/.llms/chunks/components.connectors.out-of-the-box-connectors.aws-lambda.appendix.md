# AWS Lambda connector — Appendix

### AWS authentication types

There are two options to authenticate the connector with AWS:

- Choose **Credentials** in the **Authentication** dropdown if you have a valid pair of access and secret keys provided by your AWS account administrator. This option is applicable for both SaaS and Self-Managed users.
- Choose **Default Credentials Chain (Hybrid/Self-Managed only)** in the **Authentication** dropdown if your system is configured as an implicit authentication mechanism, such as role-based authentication, credentials supplied via environment variables, or files on target host. This option is applicable only for Self-Managed or hybrid distribution. This approach uses the [Default Credential Provider Chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html) to resolve required credentials.
