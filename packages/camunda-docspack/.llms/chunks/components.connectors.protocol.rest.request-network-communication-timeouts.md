# REST connector — Request — Network communication timeouts

- **Connection timeout in seconds** determines the time frame in which the client will try to establish a connection with the server. If you do not specify a value, the system uses the default of 20 seconds. For cases where you need to wait indefinitely, set this value to 0.

- **Read timeout in seconds** is the amount of time the client will wait to read data from the server after the connection has been made. The default is also set to 20 seconds. To allow an unlimited wait time for slow responses, set this to 0.
